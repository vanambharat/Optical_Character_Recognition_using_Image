# Optical_Character_Recognition_using_Image
In this project, I extracted text from images. After extracting the text I applied some basic functions of OpenCV on that text to enhance it and to get more accurate results. This project will be very useful as it will save time and effort of typing from an image.
I started with learning how to install tesseract which is the used for text extraction. Next I took an image and extracted the text from that image. I learned that I need to use certain image transformation function of OpenCV in order to extract text from complex images.
Different organization can use this to extract useful information from the image and store it. Individuals can use it for saving their time and effort for typing.
